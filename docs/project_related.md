## Sparklink | 知识与艺术传播NFT计画
让我们想像有种特异生物，想要支助并保存人类知识。他是未来与过去的好朋友，可以借由购买NFT支助发行与散布，得以将深爱的书本、期刊、杂志放到永久保存的区块链储存机构如arweave或IPFS上，并支持学术与批判刊物、艺术家作品的出版，我们称此种新人类为"公共领域的发行人"，任何读者可以藉由传播而成为发行者，他们是5000年後保存智人知識文明高度的沈積岩之一。

In the blueprint of this project, there is a group of people who keep contributing to knowledge archiving. They are friends to either the future and the past, uploading all their beloved publications to the permanent blockchain repositories like Arweave and IPFS. Through minting and transferring NFTs, they distribute knowledge, support content creators and become "Publisher for Public Domain". SparkLink makes the Publisher for Public Domain an occupation opening to all readers, making reading an approach to publishing. In the future of SparkLink, perhaps in 5000 years, all readers could be sedimentary rocks, telling the height of the intellectual civilization of Homo sapiens.

## $COOP | 迈向合作的社会通证

INS 发行 ```$COOP```，乃是通过加密技术、区块链信任与合作精神，由下而上的发展成一个涵盖学术、科技与艺术领域的合作社群。使得社群内要交换时间与劳力，作品与服务成为可能。我们要将颠倒的世界颠倒过来，我们从合作社能学到的比更多金融专家告诉我们的更多。今天，合作经济在世界都有长足的贡献，成为共同富裕的动力，如日本消費者合作社聯盟為全國31%的家庭提供服務，巴西40%的農業、丹麥36%的零售市場都是由合作社組成的。肯亞45%、紐西蘭22%的國內生產總值都來自合作社。英國目前有20萬人在400多家合作社工作。在德國，柏林市民們目前形成公共事業合作社來購買和運營城市電網，有数量足够的多元的、跨年龄与种族的合作住宅等。而新兴的平台合作社已经在艺术、农业、交通、软体、教育、零售取得非常好的成绩。总之，区块链的本质就是合作社的本质。

In this project, the Institute of Network Society issues social token ```$COOP```, trying to make the institute a bottom-up academic cooperative in technology and art. ```$COOP``` could be used to "buy" others' time and work. It is an original currency of INS co-operative. Today, the cooperative economy has become a long-standing contributor and sharing prosperity all over the world. The Japanese Consumer Co-operative Union serves 31% of the nation’s households, 40% of Brazil’s agriculture, and 36% of Denmark’s retail market is made up of cooperatives. Kenya gets 45% of its GDP and New Zealand gets 22% of its GDP from cooperatives. In the United Kingdom, 200,000 people currently work in more than 400 cooperatives. In Germany, Berliners now form utility cooperatives to buy and operate the city’s electricity grid, and there are enough diverse, cross-age and ethnic cooperative housing. And emerging platform cooperatives have already achieved very good results in art, agriculture, transportation, softwares, education, and retail. We believe that blockchain shares the same essence to cooperatives. To turn an upside-down world upside down, cooperatives inspire us more than financial experts do.
