# Archverse ｜空间复现计画

这是由"**乡建中国思想展**"的展品之一“北碚”拓展的区块链空间复现计画。“北碚”在常与“未来”相提并论的区块链元宇宙Decentraland上重现了1930年代和1940年代的北碚城市空间。Archverse希望进一步发挥“北碚”这一作品在复现消失或濒临消失之空间的潜力，因此，网络社会研究所联合MetaDAO小组，试图在未来2-3年的元宇宙中重建更多消失或濒临消失的中国村落／文化项目。在由单一公司宣称“自由无限”的元宇宙游戏里，土地和空间的流转却通常表现为由下而上创造的区块链资产被炒作式的转移买卖；而Archverse希望在创造性地保存中国乡村与文化之余，一探元宇宙作为未来空间的所在地，多大程度上具有写就“液态历史”的潜力。

This project comes from the work "Beibei". "Beibei" represents space of Beibei city in 1930s and 1940s on the metaverse project "Decentraland"; the work was made for the exhibition "**Plot the Soil: Reconstructing the Country China**". Although metaverse is widely regarded as a part of "future", "Beibei '' shows its potential ability to represent the past. Along with Beibei spirit, this year, the Institute of Network Society cooperates with MetaDAO, trying to represent more disappeared or disappearing villages, cities and minority cultural spaces in China. Archverse is not only about creatively archive the space demolished today, but also examines to what extent does the metaverse, in which an "infinite" and "free" future was promised, is able to write liquid histories for the people, when most assets on it are designed from the bottom up and being held for sale.
